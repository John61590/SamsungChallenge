# SamsungChallenge

Interview problem / coding challenge for Android UI Developer at Samsung Research America.
The full assignment docx can be found in the repository at "Instructions.docx" and the wireframes
can be found at "Interaction_Wireframe.pdf"
The design follows the video and screenshots very carefully.

The master screen of the app has a list of the categories that are found in the assets folder
with the first image being shown to describe it. The image can also be clicked on to have
a pop-up so that they user can swipe between images in that category. When a category
is clicked, a detail screen appears with all of the images and the file names attached.

Some screenshots can be found below. Additional ones can be found in the repository.
